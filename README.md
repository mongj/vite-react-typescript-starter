# Vite-React-Typescript-Starter

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Tailwind, HMR and some ESLint rules.

This was made largely for my personal use, to streamline the process of setting up a barebone React + Typescript + Tailwind app with Vite, usually for quick testing/prototyping. This may get more fleshed out in the future, though I don't have a timeline for it.
